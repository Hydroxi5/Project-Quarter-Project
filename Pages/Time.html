      <h1>The 1st Dimension: Time</h1>
      <h2>The Aspect</h2>
      <p>Time is among the most dangerous of elements, second only to Void in destructive potential. In a state of slowed or stopped time, it is possible to accelerate objects to beyond physically possible speeds. Nuclear fusion is a possibility for
        a moving object once released from the timeflow. Dispite the name of the aspect, users cannot travel backwards in time. Thankfully, this is its own safety measure, preventing possible future changes and paradoxes. Rarely, an expert Time
        wielder catches glimpses of the future. It is theorized that with more power, a Time wielder could see <strong>all possible futures</strong>.</p>
      <h2>Government</h2>
      <p>What few settlements the Null have found show a type of cheiftain based government.</p>
      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>Due to lack of society, no technology beyond basic tools are present</p>
      <h2>Society</h2>
      <p>Unsure. No large settlements of sentience have been observed on the core planet of the First Dimension. To the Null, it's a very extensive nature reserve.</p>
      <h2>Notable Creations</h2>
      <p>There's a strange tower near the Warp Gate. It's purpose is unclear.</p>
