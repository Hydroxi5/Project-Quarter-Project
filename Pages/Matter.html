      <h1>The 3rd Dimension: Matter</h1>
      <h2>The Aspect</h2>
      <p>Matter is an aspect that allows the weilder to manipulate matter at it's smallest states. A weilder can move matter freely, change it's state, or even change the element itself by manipulating the protons, neutrons, and electrons of an atom
        or set of atoms.</p>
      <h2>Government</h2>
      <p>The 3rd Dimension is populated by many different nations, each ruled in different ways.</p>
      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>Mid-ranged Technology exists. Advancements in entertainment, such as 'Virtual Reality' have created a type of escapism among several groups of people known as 'Gamers'.</p>
      <h2>Society</h2>
      <p>Simmilar to the 2nd dimension, the citizens of several nations have a surpiriority complex. Unlike in the Second Dimension, they are unable to back it up with anything other than 'because we are'.</p>
      <h2>Notable Creations</h2>
      <p>The Nation known as 'America' was the first to develop a weapon that utelized the energy released by the fusion of matter. It was named the 'Atomic Bomb'</p>
