      <h1>The 2nd Dimension: Space</h1>
      <h2>The Aspect</h2>
      <p>Space is a primarily practicle aspect. The wielder can expand and contract space at will, as well as connecting two seperate points in space for instantanious travel.</p>
      <h2>Government</h2>
      <p>The Second Dimension has many different nations, each ruled in different ways.</p>
      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <p>Mid-ranged technology is present, allowing for the building of large structures of artificial material such as concrete. Standard entertainment is available to most.</p>
      <h2>Society</h2>
      <p>The core planet consists of two primary species, Humans and Draconis. As the weaker group, Humans are looked down on and often used as servents for high-ranking Draconis. Otherwise, the dimension is simmilar in society to the 3rd Dimension.</p>
      <h2>Notable Creations</h2>
      <p>Rumor has it, the Draconis are working on a new type of weapon that warps space to create devistating damage. The likelyhood of the rumors being true is low, but still a possibility...</p>
